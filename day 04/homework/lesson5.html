<h1>white headed capuchino</h1>
<p>Cebus imitator, the Panamanian white-faced capuchin, also known as the Panamanian white-headed capuchin or Central American white-faced capuchin
    Cebus capucinus, the Colombian white-faced capuchin, also known as the Colombian white-headed capuchin
    There are 2 subspecies of Colombian white-headed capuchin:[1]
    
    C. c. capucinus
    C. c. curtus (Gorgona white-headed capuchin)
    C. imitator has a range in Central America, in Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama.[1] The range of C. capucinus is primarily in South America, in western Colombia and northwest Ecuador, although its range extends into the easternmost portion of Panama.[1] C. c. curtus has a range restricted to Gorgona Island, while C. c. capucinus covers the remainder of the C. capucinus range.[1]
    
    The two species differ slightly in appearance. Both are smallish monkeys which have black bodies, tails and limbs, with white faces, throats, chests and shoulders. But females of C. imitator have brownish or grayish elongated frontal tufts which are lacking in C. capucinus.[1][2]
    
    C. imitator had been regarded as a subspecies of C. capucinus until genetic studies in the 2010s revealed that the two species separated as much as 2 million years ago.[3][4] Although the Colombian white-headed capuchin retained the scientific name C. capucinus from prior to the species being split, almost all previous research on white-faced capuchins under the name C. capucinus had actually been on the Central American species C. imitator as there have not been any field studies on the South American species.[4]</p>

    The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic and nearby areas. It is closely related to the brown bear, and the two species can interbreed. The polar bear is the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). The species is sexually dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller. The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.
